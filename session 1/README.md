# Tutorial 1

## Setup

In addition to Python3 (3.6 and above) and Jupyter notebooks, the following packages are needed for the tutorial:

- alphacsc,
- dtw-python,
- ipython,
- loadmydata,
- matplotlib,
- numpy,
- pandas,
- scikit-learn,
- scipy,
- statsmodels.

All are available from pip or conda, except two:

- `alphacsc` is only available from a github repository. To install, run `pip install git+https://github.com/alphacsc/alphacsc.git`. DO NOT install `alphacsc` from pypi directly as this version is obsolete.
- `dtw-python` is only available from PyPI. To install, run `pip install dtw-python`.
